        <p> Three butterflies native to the Western part of the United States are:</p>

Phyciodes mylitta Mylitta Crescent </bold>
 Life History: Males perch or patrol all day near host plants for females. Eggs are deposited on underside of host plant leaves; caterpillars eat leaves. Young caterpillars may live in a small silken nest; partially-grown caterpillars hibernate.
Flight: Two broods in the north from April-September, several in the south from February-November.
Caterpillar Hosts: Native thistles (Cirsium), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and European thistles (Carduus).
Adult Food: Flower nectar.
Habitat: From sea level to 8000 feet in mountains, fields, meadows, roads, vacant lots, parks, and fencerows.
Range: Southern British Columbia southeast through the Rocky Mountain region to Mexico; south to Washington, Oregon, and California.
        
<p> <bold>Polygonia satyrus Satyr Comma</bold></p>
 Life History: In late afternoon, males perch on tree trunks and low vegetation in woodland openings to watch for females. Eggs are laid singly, in stacks, or in groups on the lower side of nettle leaves. Caterpillars eat leaves and make a shelter by pulling down and fastening the edges of a leaf with silk. Adults hibernate.
Flight: Two to three flights on the Pacific Coast from February-November; two flights in Colorado, Nevada, and Saskatchewan from June-September; one flight in remainder of range from July-September.
Caterpillar Hosts: Various nettles (Urticaceae species).
Adult Food: Tree sap, rotting fruit, flower nectar including that from blackberry and almond.
Habitat: Valley bottoms, along streams, wooded prairie ravines, marshes, openings in riparian woods, fields and edges near moist woods.
Range: Southern Yukon and Northwest Territories south through western Canada and western United States to Baja California, southern Arizona, and southwest New Mexico; east across the Great Lakes states to northern New England and Nova Scotia.
        
    <p><bold>Vanessa annabella West Coast Lady</bold></p> 
Life History: Males perch to watch for receptive females. Females lay eggs singly on upperside of host plant leaves; caterpillars eat leaves and live in a silken nest. Adults hibernate.
Flight: Many flights throughout the year in lowland California; two flights, summer and fall, in the Rocky Mountains; one flight in higher mountains.
Caterpillar Hosts: Many plants in the mallow family (Malvaceae) including tree mallow (Lavatera), globe mallow (Sphaeralcea), bush mallow (Malvastrum), mallow (Malva), alkali mallow (Sida), checkerbloom (Sidalcea), and hollyhock (Althea).
Adult Food: Flower nectar.
Habitat: Open places including weedy areas, gardens, roadsides, fields, foothills, chaparral, disturbed areas.
Range: Western North America from southern British Columbia south to Baja California Norte; south and east to Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, and Mexico. Strays to central Kansas, eastern North Dakota, and southern Ontario.</p>
