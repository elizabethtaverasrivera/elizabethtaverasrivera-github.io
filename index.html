        <h3>Butterflies</h3> 
        <p>Part of the insect family, lepidoptera, butterflies bring color and magic to our world. Like most insects, butterflies use their antenas to sense smells, using their feet to taste.<br /> <p>While butterflies appear fragile they can as long as one year. Butterflies are found in most part of the world and there are over 25, 000 species. </p>
        <p>One of the most impressive aspect of a butterfly's life is its metamorphosis.</p>

      <h3>A Butterfly's Life Cycle</h3>
      <p class="clear">Butterflies develop thorugh 4 stages: </p>
          <ol>
              <li>Egg
                  <ul>
                  <li>Eggs are laid on leaves.</li>
                  <li>Eggs become minute. </li>
                  <li>This cycle lasts approximately 5 days.</li>
                      </ul>
                </li>        
            <li>Caterpillar or Larvae
                <ul>
                    <li>Caterpillars have 6-10 pairs of legs. </li>
                    <li><They resemble worms./li>
                   <li>Caterpillars feed from the leaves and flowers in its environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
           <li>Chrysalis or Pupa
               <ul>
                  <li>In the chrysalis stage, butterflies feed on plants as well as aphids or small insects.</li>
                   <li>At this stage, the butterfly is done growing</li>
                   <li>The final stage of the metamorphosis is completed in this stage.</li>
               </ul>
              </li>   
              <li>Butterfly
                  <ul>
                      <li>Adult butterflies feed on nectar they find in flowers.</li>
                      <li>The butterflies use their tongues to sip from the flowers.</li>
                     <li>However, some butterflies feed on tree sap.</li>
                 </ul>
              </li>
      </ol>

       <h3>A World Without Butterflies</h3>
       <p class="clear">We need Butterflies These collectively provide a wide range of environmental benefits, including pollination and natural pest control.</p>
<p>Moths and butterflies are an important element of the food chain and are prey for birds, bats and other insectivorous animals (for example, in Britain and Ireland, Blue Tits eat an estimated 50 billion moth caterpillars each year).</p>
<p>Butterflies support a range of other predators and parasites, many of which are specific to individual species, or groups of species.</p></div>
